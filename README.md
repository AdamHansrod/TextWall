TextWall
========

Struts2 Java webapp, using the Twilio service for a text message to webpage service.

At the moment it doesn't store the messages anywhere, always pulling the messages from Twilio.

The webapp rudimentally allows for people to set username's once via texting the username before a : in a text message, it will then apply that username for all texts from the same phone number.

Dependant on the twilio sdk
